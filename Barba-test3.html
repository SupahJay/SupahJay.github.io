                <p>What I plan testing in this website:</p>
                <li>What happend with the two diferents wrappers<br>I.E: The outer div content load? Its inline content loads? And the inner one's too?</li>
                <li>What happend with the two diferents wrappers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is the third page.<br> It has no background and has the same plugin but this time between the two tags. Will they reaload(pop-up)?<br> What is the font here?<br> it also has a pop up inside the inner tag, will it pop-up every time or will it disappear?</p>
            <p>I love ducks but didn't eat one so far ( ;-;)</p>
